|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `Configuration\`                 | `Configuration/`          |
| `Core\`                          | `Core/`                   |
| `Core\Model\`                    | `Core/Model/`             |
| `Core\View\`                     | `Core/View/`              |
| `Core\Controller\`               | `Core/Controller/`        |
