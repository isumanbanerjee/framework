## Autoloading

This framework uses PSR-4 autoloading for easy management of namespaces and files. Below is the namespace-to-directory mapping:

| Namespace                        | Directory                 |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `Configuration\`                 | `Configuration/`          |
| `Core\`                          | `Core/`                   |
| `Core\Model\`                    | `Core/Model/`             |
| `Core\View\`                     | `Core/View/`              |
| `Core\Controller\`               | `Core/Controller/`        |
| `System\Model\`                  | `System/Model/`           |
| `System\View\`                   | `System/View/`            |
| `System\Controller\`             | `System/Controller/`      |

### Namespace Overview

- **Core**: Contains the core functionality of the framework that is fundamental and immutable. These classes should not be altered as they provide the essential building blocks of the framework.
- **System**: Includes classes that inherit and extend functionality from the Core namespace, allowing customization and project-specific logic while maintaining the integrity of core functionalities.| Namespace                        | Directory                  |
  |----------------------------------|---------------------------|
  | `Configuration\`                 | `Configuration/`          |
  | `Core\`                          | `Core/`                   |
  | `Core\Model\`                    | `Core/Model/`             |
  | `Core\View\`                     | `Core/View/`              |
  | `Core\Controller\`               | `Core/Controller/`        |
  | `System\Model\`                  | `System/Model/`           |
  | `System\View\`                   | `System/View/`            |
  | `System\Controller\`             | `System/Controller/`      |
